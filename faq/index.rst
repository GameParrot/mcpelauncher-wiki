Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Do I need to own Minecraft: Pocket Edition to play?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Yes. To download and update a compatible versions of the Game, the Google Play account you sign in with needs to own the game on the Play Store.
Then you are able to download and play some previous versions of the game as well, althought not offically supported by Google Play.

The launcher **cannot** download the game from:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The Amazon App store, althought may or may not work on arm devices. You have to extract the apk from an amazon device.

The launcher **cannot** download and **cannot** launch the game from:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This would require a completly different Launcher, if that would even possible

- The Apple iOS App store
- The Microsoft Store, previously by redeeming a gift code for Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition

Does it work on Windows 7 / 8?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
No, due to the amount of work required to get this running on Windows. Play the Windows 10 Edition instead if you can.
Note that you can not play Minecraft in the current version of `Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux>`__, as the mouse input is broken due to an `issue <https://github.com/microsoft/wslg/issues/240>`__ with its graphic stack.

How does it work?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The project runs the native libraries from the Android version directly on your computer. This is accomplished by fixing the incompatibilities between the libc used on Android and the one used on desktop Linux or OS X (Android - Bionic; Linux - glibc). This is a simple compatibility layer which doesn't impact performance in any significant way; it's similar to Wine, but much more lightweight and simple. Aditionally, all Android-specific code has been rewritten to run on Linux (AppPlatform, Store, Xbox Live, etc.).

Where are my worlds?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Linux: :code:`~/.local/share/mcpelauncher/games/com.mojang/minecraftWorlds`

Linux (Flatpak): :code:`~/.var/app/io.mrarm.mcpelauncher/data/mcpelauncher/games/com.mojang/minecraftWorlds`

Mac OS X: :code:`~/Library/Application Support/mcpelauncher/games/com.mojang/minecraftWorlds`

Each world has its own directory. If you have multiple worlds, you can identify them by their name in :code:`levelname.txt` found in each world.

The :code:`mcpelauncher-server` creates and expects its world files in :code:`world`.

Can I use resource packs?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Yes, put them in :code:`~/.local/share/mcpelauncher/games/com.mojang/resource_packs`.

(For Flatpak) :code:`~/.var/app/io.mrarm.mcpelauncher/data/mcpelauncher/games/com.mojang/resource_packs`

For Mac OS X, put them in :code:`~/Library/Application Support/mcpelauncher/games/com.mojang/resource_packs`.

Shaders are also resource packs. (Shaders must be GLSL based and must be compatible with your graphics drivers)

**Note:** You will probably need to extract :code:`.zip` and :code:`.mcpack` files into their own subdirectory for them to work properly.

Why would I want to use this projects server, instead of the official one?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If...

- the official one doesn't work for you
- you need scripting on the server
- some rarely needed particular modding capabilities
